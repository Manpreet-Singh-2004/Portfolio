        <p>I have worked as an digital intern for <a href="https://www.digitalseries.in/" target="_blank" style="padding: 0%; margin: 0%; text-decoration: none; color: blue;">Digital series</a>, which was founded by <a href="https://in.linkedin.com/in/nitin-rai-chaudhary-23643b22" target="_blank" style="padding: 0%; margin: 0%; text-decoration: none; color: blue;">Nitin Rai Chaudhary</a> where i had to work in 3 major departments, which
        were Social media management (SMM), Search Engine Optimisation (SEO) and Website Management (WM).</p>
        <br>
        <p>Working in these fields has helped me a lot in order to advance my skills and know more about how a business and what applied skills that are required by companies.
            I started working in WM, which improved my skills in WordPress and soon enough I grasped how it worked.
            My main role was to post albums/pictures, blogs, news, tables, etc for our clients (which were schools and Doctors).
            Some of my other roles included testing the websites for any bugs, testing the website for any broken links, and providing feedback.


        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            We keep working in different fields, and the next department that I was sent to was Search Engine Optimize (SEO).
            In this department, my main role was to create backlinks, website submissions, business listings, PPTs and PDF submissions, Creating Advertisements for our clients,
            Crawling the website, improving the ranking of our website and Social bookmarking. This was my main department, where I worked for most of the time.


        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Last, but not least, I worked in Social Media Management (SMM) where I had to manage the social media handles of our clients and keep updating them about the new albums and news.
            This helps to keep engagement and increase them steadily, we also made weekly reports and sent them to our clients.

            TechGear is a program in which we work with a foreign company and help them. The client may require anything like a website or a mobile application. But for 2023 Techgear (UFV_India_Cohort3)
            I worked for a company named <a href="#" target="_blank" style="padding: 0%; margin: 0%; text-decoration: none; color: blue;">Paragon PMO</a>, where we had to work with our coordinator  <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dhalie-patara/" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none; padding: 0%; margin: 0%; color: blue;">Dhalie Patara</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ronel-alberts/" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none; padding: 0%; margin: 0%; color: blue;">Ronel Alberts</a> in order to develop an 
            mobile application for our client <a href="https://legacy.camosun.ca/learn/school/access/archives/2021-2022/2021-Fall/ACF/MATH-037-S03-Nicolas-Mai.pdf" target="_blank" style="padding: 0%; margin: 0%; text-decoration: none; color: blue;">Nicolas Mai</a>, who is a professor

            <br>
            We had to make an application for the First Nation population of Canada so that they can clear their Driving License test. It is very important to have a driving license in Canada since the distances are very apart and it is very hard to commute from one place to another without the help of any vehicle.
    To complete our objective we first have to make user stories. User stories are very important since it helps us make a blueprint of the whole application, for example, what our client wants and what features would our end user or admin users may require. For this, we mainly used the following tools -: <br>
        <ul>
                <li>Slack</li>
                <li>Smartsheet</li>
                <li>Figma</li>
                <li>Making Database Using Excel</li>

        </ul>
