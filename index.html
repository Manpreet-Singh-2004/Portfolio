        were Social media management (SMM), Search Engine Optimisation (SEO) and Website Management (WM).</p>
        <br>
        <p>Working in these fields has helped me a lot in order to advance my skills and know more about how a business and what are the applied skills that are required by companies.
            I started Working in WM, which improved my skills in <b>WordPress</b> and soon enough I grasped how it worked.
            My main role was to post albums/pictures, blogs, news, tables, etc for our clients (which were schools and Doctors).
            Some of my other roles included testing the websites for any bugs and testing the website for any broken links, providing feedback.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>We keep working in different fields, and the next department that i was sent to was Search Engine Optimize (SEO).
            In this department, my main role was to create backlinks, website submissions, business listing, PPTs and PDF submissions, Creating Advertisements for our client,
            Crawling the website, improving the ranking of our website and Social book marking. This was my main department, where i worked for most of the time.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Last but not the least, i worked in Social Media Management (SMM) where i had to manage the social media handels of our clients, keep updating about the new albums and news.
            This helps to keep engagement and increase them steadely, we also made weekly reports and sent them to our clients.
